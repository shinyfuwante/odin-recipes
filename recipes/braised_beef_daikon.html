    <h4>A cozy stew inspired by East Asian flavors with beef and daikon radish.</h4>
    <p> This stew is a pleasure of mine to make and consume. The beef becomes so tender and the daikon helps compliment the unctiousness
        of the beef. In addition, this can be easily handled by the Instant Pot!
